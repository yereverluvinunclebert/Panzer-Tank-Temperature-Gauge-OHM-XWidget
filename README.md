This Panzer widget is an attractive dieselpunk Xwidget for your desktop. 
It is a simple temperature gauge that can monitor the state of the various 
components in your machine via the reported temperatures. It uses the Open 
Hardware Monitor tool to extract the temperatures. Functional and gorgeous at 
the same time. This Widget is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere 
around the desktop as you require.

The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key 
and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.

To find out how the widget operates, simply right click and select Help and a 
full explanation of all the buttons and windows, is shown. The top left window is 
the maximum temperature experienced by the chosen sensor, top right window is 
the current temperature in digital form. The bottom right window is the current 
scale used. The middle button selects the scale. Hovering over any control 
should supply a pop-up explaining each function.

I took the screenshot photo. It looks like 1944 but it was 2004! The image above 
was shot at Beltring in Kent. I've had to do some serious photoshopping to 
remove any traces of modernity. There were lots. Addition of some grain, 
desaturation and addition of some light brown to give it a hint of old picture. 
I don't want it to look too old as it loses some of the immediacy.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses the XWidget engine. The engine interprets the javascript and creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you provide.

This widget is a virtual duplicate of the Yahoo widget CPU battery widget that 
you can find here:

The graphic interface and operation of the two types of widgets are the same. The 
only differences are the configuration preference utility (this has a cut-down 
version), the language is Micrososoft's JScript (rather than javascript) and it is the Xwidget engine that is utilised to put the widget on your screen.

This widget is uploaded here for historical archival reasons. I suggest that you 
use the Yahoo widget version as it is a superior engine for developing widgets. 
I will provide bugfixes for the Yahoo widget version but NOT for Xwidgets.

All Jscript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the XWidget engine. The engine interprets the Jscript and creates the widget 
according to the XML description and using the images you provide.
